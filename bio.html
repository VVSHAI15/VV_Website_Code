        <h2>About AviShai Dayanim</h2>
        <p>AviShai Dayanim is a composer, orchestrator, producer, and storyteller based in the Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, M.D. area. He is currently a sophomore Dual Degree student pursuing both a Bachelor of Music in Music for New Media and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the Peabody Institute and the Johns Hopkins University.</p>

        <p>A pianist with a classical foundation and a jazz bass player with soulful depth, AviShai's true artistic calling is in the realm of composition. His compositions traverse a wide spectrum of genres and styles, from the intricate textures of hybrid scores to the gritty nostalgia of retro synth-wave, from the gentle simplicity of minimalist piano pieces to the grandeur of expansive orchestral works. To AviShai, there is not a style of music that he can't translate into a story.</p>

        <p>What sets AviShai apart is his unique ability to meld his musical passion with his technical skills. AviShai crafts sounds unique to him, transforming them into VST instruments that he uses to elevate his work. This innovative approach has earned him spots in prestigious workshops, including the notable 2021 NYU/BMI TV Scoring Workshop, the NYU Scoring for Videogames Workshop, and an invitation to the NYU/BMI Scoring for Advertising Workshop. Continuing his artistic journey, AviShai's participation in the NYU Film Scoring Workshop as a Chamber composer in 2022 stands as a testament to his growth and dedication.</p>

        <p>AviShai has composed for various forms of media ranging from short films, to theater productions, to small-scale videogames along with participating in numerous film scoring competitions - most notably, being a top 10 international finalist in the Indie Film Music Contest in 2021. AviShai's original scores have also accompanied films to festivals, recently being awarded Best Original Score at the 8 & HalFilm awards, the Frida Film Festival, and the Greenflash International Film Festival for his work on The Velvet Rose.</p>
